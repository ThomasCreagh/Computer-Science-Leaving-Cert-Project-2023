- Reseach Games to use
- Realised not use Tik Tak Toe because of hard logic
- Found 4 in a row

# 07/12/2022
- Looked at modeling
- Finished bugs inside text game
- Game works exalently with connect 4, now i will make it scalable.

# 08/12/2022
- Looking at Monte Carlo method
- Looking at the sequences within the varible of the sides and how much symbols you have to connect to win

# 12/12/2022
- Made the game scalable with what ever board size you want and how many symbols you need in a row to win
- Made more dynamic code with functions
- Make a working level 0 npc (a random number player)
- reasearched about gradient decent in backpropagation

# 15/12/2022
- abstract rules of the game
- definition of abstraction
- research

# 21/12/2022
- Researched on genarational neural network

# 10/01/2023
- Realised I shouldnt use a neural network
- Programmed the game to use classes instead of just functions
- Made the game log data to a csv file
- It can now be run 1000+ times when nessasary to generate new data

# 14/01/2023
- Added a lot of comments to explain my code
